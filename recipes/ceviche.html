    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Peruvian fish cebiche recipe prepared with fresh fish, limes, onions, spicy peppers, and cilantro. Served with boiled corn, sweet potato, plantain chips, and/or cancha or Andean corn nuts</p>
    <h2>Ingredients (06 servings - Apetizer):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds very fresh and high quality fish filets</li>
        <li>1 red onion</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>1-2 habanero peppers</li>
        <li>2-3 sprigs of fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Finely chopped cilantro to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To serve:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Cancha, tostado or chulpe corn nuts</li>
        <li>Fresh boiled corn</li>
        <li>Sweet potato: thinly fried or baked chips or boiled thick slices</li>
        <li>Chifles or fried green plantain chips</li>
        <li>Diced or sliced hot peppers - optiona</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the fish into small cubes, place in a glass bowl and cover with cold water and 1 tablespoon of salt, cover and refrigerate while you prepare the onions and juice the limes.</li>
        <li>Rub the thin onion slices with 1/2 tablespoon of salt and rinse in cold water.</li>
        <li>Rinse the fish to remove the salt</li>
        <li>Place the cubes of fish, half of the sliced onions, and hot peppers in a glass bowl and pour the lime juice over the ingredients. Sprinkle with a little bit of salt. To minimize the acidity of the limes you can put a few ice cubes in the mix.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for about 5-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the cilantro sprigs and the hot peppers from the mix. Taste the fish ceviche and add additional salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Use a spoon to place the ceviche in each serving bowl, add additional sliced onions to each bowl, sprinkle with finely chopped cilantro, and diced or sliced hot peppers.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with your choice of sides and garnishes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <p>Soaking the fish in cold salt water helps it keep a firm texture. Rinsing the onions with salt and cold water helps remove their bitterness. Adding ice cubes to the cebiche mix helps neutralize the acidity of the limes – this is especially true for the South American limon sutil variety, but less needed for the Mexican limes found in the US.</p>
